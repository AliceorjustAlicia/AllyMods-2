# [DOWNLOAD LATEST BUILD](https://github.com/AliceorjustAlicia/AllyMods-2/releases/tag/Beeta)

Here before you lays the fine magestry of modding on The Sims 4!

A simple and beautiful/customizable interface for your two eyes (unless you don't have eyes, or one less... or maybe you're an alien and can still read this?)

It is being actively worked on, residing within its BETA version.
